# Migrating a Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Glutamatergic (GLU) Neuron from NEURON to COMSOL Multiphysics

This MATLAB code imports a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal glutamatergic (GLU) neuron from the NEURON framework into COMSOL Multiphysics. 

## Usage

1. Run the MATLAB script.
2. The code will generate a COMSOL model that can be further modified to:
   - Increase the number of neurons
   - Add background noise
   - Incorporate electrodes to record extracellular signals from the specified neuron

## Output

Running the script creates a COMSOL Multiphysics environment with the neuron embedded within a surrounding grey matter domain, ready for simulation and further modification. As shown in the video below.
